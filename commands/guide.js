Install a version of Java 8 from here [https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html]\nSo what you are going to have to do is select your operating system E.G. Windows, Linux, Mac OS. You will also have to check whether your Windows is 64 bit or 32 bit (If you are running on Windows).\nYou can do this by going to your files and right clicking "This PC" and it will show under system type.\n2. So once you have installed Java you are going to want to go to your Technic launcher and click "Launcher Options" [https://gyazo.com/ffcb9bd112e11b2b8465557bc6c2cd0a]\n3. Select "Java Settings" [https://gyazo.com/e32e40a251d8aeb61e20f5feba0bff0c]\n4. Choose your new version of Java [https://gyazo.com/86a6f955f62be5751dbb234fe74ae10c]\n I recommend that you only allocate around 2-3GB depending on how much RAM [or memory] you have on your PC. Having too much ram allocated can also cause crashes and for your CPU to overwork itself.\nYou may need to do some testing and adjusting to the amount of memory to allocate.')
